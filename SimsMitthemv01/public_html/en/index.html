        <h1 class="eng">What is SPRECO?</h1>

        <p class="eng green-indent">Spreco is a company that turns mainly to the tenant and condominium associations, where the aim is to offer smart living solutions that avoid wrong recycling of household waste. The idea was raised while a tenant company in Sundsvall find problems in their garbage handling process and waste management, and therefore wanted external help. The project focused on if it was possible to make financial savings in the organization if the recycling process turned out better, but also with hope to safeguarding our environment.</p>

        <p class="eng">Many neighbourhoods provide handling of both food and household waste, while the remaining areas only provides handling of household waste. At the places where it is possible to recycle both food waste and household waste, it often becomes wrong recycled food waste, and this gives great economic consequences. The most common error is around the food waste bag, a plastic bag is wrapped around before it is being thrown in the compost, the brown dustbin. This is a behaviour that is strictly prohibited since plastic is not degradable by nature. The problem is further uncontrollable because it is not possible to track who thrown their food waste in the wrong way.</p>

        <p class="eng">Spreco is an outside- solution to the bins that exists in the market today. The compartment has a simple design where the barrels runs through a simple doorway and on the top of the compartment there are three pitfalls. Trapdoors identify the color of the bag, and if the bag has the right color, it will be recycled. A green indicator will also be given to symbolize that you recycled properly. If the bag that is trying to be disposed on the other hand have a wrong color, it will not be released down in the dustbin, and a red light will be given that indicates something is wrong.</p>

        <p class="eng">On Spreco we focus on sustainable development with focus on the environment, where the customer needs is our challenge to meet. We are service-oriented and want to solve your needs. Contact us if you experience problems in your business- we will gladly help you!</p>
