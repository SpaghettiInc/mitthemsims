        <h2 class="eng" id="a1">Fluorescent Lamps</h2>
        <p class="eng">Fluorescent lamps sorts as hazardous waste because they contains mercury. Fluorescent lamps are electronic products, but will be sorted and delivered separately to be properly cared for. You can leave your used fluorescent lamps at the recycling center where they are divided into metal, glass and filling. Be careful not to break these lamps as it increases leaking and spread of mercury. Recycling fluorescent lamps contributes to detoxication of our natures cycle.</p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a2">Light bulbs</h2>
        <p class="eng">All kinds of light bulbs can be recycled. You leave them as hazardous waste at the nearest recycling center or at a store where you could buy new ones. Old light bulbs could contain lead, which is particularly important to recycle properly. Bulbs should not be placed in the glass recycling.</p>
        <p class="eng top"><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a3">Batteries</h2>
        <p class="eng">At the recycling stations or in some of the garbage rooms there are boxes for battery disposal. If not, you can sort them as hazardous waste. Discarded gadgets with built-in batteries could be left at recycling containers labeled “Miscellaneous electronics” or “Small-electricity” The various materials in a battery is separated and reused as much as possible. Some batteries can be recycled up to 98 %. Battery chargers are recycled as electronic waste.</p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a4">Food Waste</h2>
        <p class="eng">In your apartment you have a brown bin where you put a brown, recyclable sorting bag which you throw all your food waste in. It is important that it does not end up any other garbage than food in this bag when it is supposed to be composted. Your food waste you throw in the brown containers available in some of Mitthems neighborhoods.</p>
        <p class="eng">It is very important that no other object than the brown bag and food scraps fall into this bin. Do not fill the brown bag with more waste than up to the written edge inside the bag. It is strictly forbidden to enclose the brown bag with a plastic bag and throw it in the brown recycling container.</p>
        <p class="eng top"><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a5">Cardboard</h2>
        <p class="eng">Paperboard packaging is okay to throw in Mitthems recycling bins for paper packaging. A rule of thumb might be: "Was it something in the paper package when I bought it?". If the answer is yes to the question, then you can throw the paperboard in the recycling container, otherwise you should throw away the carton in the combustible household waste. Paper packaging could be beverage containers, bag-in- box- wine packages, pizza boxes, a shoe box, cake box or egg carton.</p>
        <p class="eng">Rinse out your package before leaving it in the recycling container and if possible, remove plastic parts. For example unscrew the cork on your milk packaging and sorting it in the plastic container, and then throw the rest of the paperboard packaging with unremovable plastic parts in the container for paper packaging.</p>
        <p class="eng">Your moving boxes that you want to get rid of you can put in the coarse garbage room who are located in your neighborhood. These will be sorted as corrugated cardboard.</p>
        <p class="eng top"><a href="#"><i class="fa fa-chevron-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Top</a></p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a6">Newspaper</h2>
        <p class="eng">All your newspapers, whether it be a newspaper, magazine or newspaper, are welcome to be sorted in Mitthems container for Newspapers. The exceptions are the post-it notes, envelopes and plastic paper. The reason why these are forbidden to throw in the container for newspaper is because of the adhesive found on these objects, which will ultimately destroy the new pulp. If your newspaper on the other hand are stapled or having a spiral binding you can let them stay, they will be sorted out at a later stage.</p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a7">Plastic</h2>
        <p class="eng">Packaging made out of plastic should be thrown in the bin dedicated to plastic in your garbage room or station. Examples of plastic packaging could be grocery bags, thai food containers or cherry tomato boxes. You should not throw hard plastic objects such as gasoline containers, floor ball sticks or strainers.</p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a8">Glass</h2>
        <p class="eng">Most glass bottles and containers can be thrown here in the bin dedicated to glass, keep in mind to separate the coloured glass from the non-coloured glass. Also remember to take of the lid which is usually not made out of glass. Things that should not be thrown here are among other lightbulbs, mirrors and drinking glasses these need to be taken to a garbage disposal station.</p>

        <h2 class="eng" id="a9">Metal</h2>
